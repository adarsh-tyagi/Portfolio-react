    "bio": "Hi there! I am Adarsh! My developer journey started in 2016 when I started my engineering degree. Everything was new and tricky for me but at the same time also got interested in programming. My first step was learning the C language and honestly it was hard but as I continued to learn it goes easy eventually. Then I learned data structures, most important and hardest part for me in this journey. Then I got confidence and learned other skills also like Python, JavaScript, Machine Learning. I have completed my engineering and got a job in 2020. I learned about DevOps technologies but web development is something I got interested and I have learned HTML, CSS and MERN stack. Docker and Kubernetes are the techs that I liked in DevOps. I have worked on many web development personal projects. I am still learning and improving beacuse learning is lifetime process.",
