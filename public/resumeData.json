    "bio": "Hi I am Adarsh Tyagi, I completed my B.Tech from Computer Science in 2020. First programming language that I learned was C in 2016. After that I learned Java and Data Structure. Also started doing problem solving on Hackerearth and got 5 star in Java and once I was ranked under 35k globally in Java problem solving. After that I moved to Python and best language that I learned. Also learned little bit of machine learning and done some hands on Scikit learn and Keras library. In Job, I started from DevOps technologies and I also started learning MERN stack. I learned JavaScript, HTML & CSS, React and Node. I like to work on Web development but Machine learning is also something I am excited about.",
